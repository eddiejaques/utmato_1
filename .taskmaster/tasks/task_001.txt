# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a monorepo structure with separate directories for frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) components.
# Details:
Initialize a Git repository with the following structure:
- `/frontend`: Next.js project
- `/backend`: FastAPI project
- `/docs`: Documentation
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts

Set up basic README.md with project overview and setup instructions. Configure .gitignore for both Next.js and Python projects. Initialize package.json and requirements.txt files with core dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure is correctly set up with all necessary configuration files. Ensure both frontend and backend projects can be initialized and run independently.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository with proper structure and initial commit
### Details:
Create a new Git repository, add .gitignore file for Node.js and Python, set up README.md with project overview, and make the initial commit. Configure branch protection rules if needed.

## 2. Set Up Frontend Next.js Project [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize and configure the Next.js frontend application
### Details:
Create a new Next.js project in the 'frontend' directory. Configure TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. Set up the basic folder structure (pages, components, styles, utils). Install essential dependencies and create a sample home page to verify setup.

## 3. Set Up Backend FastAPI Project [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize and configure the FastAPI backend application
### Details:
Create a new FastAPI project in the 'backend' directory. Set up virtual environment, requirements.txt, and basic project structure (routers, models, services). Implement a health check endpoint and configure CORS to allow frontend connections.

## 4. Create Documentation Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up documentation files and utility scripts
### Details:
Create a 'docs' directory with markdown files for API documentation, development setup guide, and project architecture. Add utility scripts for common development tasks in a 'scripts' directory. Include detailed instructions for local development setup.

## 5. Configure Development Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up configuration files and development environment
### Details:
Create environment configuration files (.env.example) for both frontend and backend. Set up Docker and docker-compose for containerized development. Configure VSCode settings and extensions recommendations. Ensure consistent coding standards across the project.

## 6. Implement Dependency Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5
### Description: Set up package management and dependency tracking
### Details:
Configure package.json for frontend dependencies with proper versioning. Set up requirements.txt and potentially poetry for backend dependency management. Create scripts for dependency updates and security audits. Document the dependency update process.
