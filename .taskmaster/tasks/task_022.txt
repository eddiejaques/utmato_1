# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Database Backup and Recovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up automated database backup and recovery procedures for data protection.
# Details:
1. Configure daily automated backups for the Supabase database
2. Enable Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for at least 7 days
3. Document the recovery process step-by-step
4. Test the recovery process at least once
5. Set up monitoring and alerts for backup failures
6. Create a backup retention policy
7. Implement a script for manual backup initiation
8. Document disaster recovery procedures

# Test Strategy:
Test the backup process by verifying backup files are created correctly. Test the recovery process by restoring a database from backup. Verify PITR works by recovering to a specific point in time. Test alert notifications for backup failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Automated Backup Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up automated database backups with appropriate scheduling and retention policies
### Details:
Configure automated backups to run daily during off-peak hours. Implement appropriate retention policies (daily backups for 7 days, weekly backups for 1 month, monthly backups for 1 year). Test the backup process to ensure it completes successfully without impacting system performance.

## 2. Point-in-Time Recovery Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Implement point-in-time recovery capability for the database system
### Details:
Configure transaction log backups to enable point-in-time recovery. Set up appropriate storage for transaction logs with sufficient capacity. Document the recovery window based on storage constraints. Test the point-in-time recovery process to verify functionality.

## 3. Manual Backup Script Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop scripts for manual backup initiation and verification
### Details:
Create shell/PowerShell scripts that can trigger manual backups when needed. Include verification steps in the scripts to confirm backup integrity. Add documentation within the scripts explaining usage parameters and expected outcomes. Test scripts in development environment before deployment.

## 4. Recovery Process Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2, 22.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for database recovery procedures
### Details:
Document step-by-step recovery procedures for different scenarios (complete restoration, point-in-time recovery, partial data recovery). Include prerequisites, estimated recovery times, and verification steps. Create a decision tree to help determine the appropriate recovery method based on the incident type.

## 5. Recovery Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of recovery procedures in isolated environments
### Details:
Set up isolated test environments that mirror production. Execute recovery procedures following the documentation. Measure recovery times and success rates. Identify and address any gaps in the recovery process or documentation. Document test results and improvements made.

## 6. Monitoring and Alerting Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.3
### Description: Set up monitoring and alerting for backup processes and status
### Details:
Implement monitoring for backup job status, backup size trends, and storage capacity. Configure alerts for backup failures, unusual backup sizes, or approaching storage limits. Create a dashboard for backup health visualization. Document alert response procedures for the operations team.
