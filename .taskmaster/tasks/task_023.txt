# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment workflows for automated testing and deployment.
# Details:
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD
2. Set up automated testing for frontend and backend
3. Configure linting and code quality checks
4. Implement build processes for frontend and backend
5. Set up deployment to Vercel for the frontend
6. Configure containerized deployment for the backend (Render, Fly.io, or AWS ECS)
7. Implement database migration steps in the deployment process
8. Add environment-specific configuration management
9. Set up deployment notifications

# Test Strategy:
Test the CI/CD pipeline by making changes to the codebase and verifying that tests run, builds complete, and deployments succeed. Verify that database migrations are correctly applied during deployment. Test rollback procedures for failed deployments.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up automated testing workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure CI pipeline to run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests automatically on code changes
### Details:
Implement GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pull requests and pushes to main branches. Configure test runners for both frontend and backend tests. Set up test reporting and notifications for failed tests. Ensure proper caching of dependencies to speed up test runs.

## 2. Implement linting and code quality checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Add automated code quality verification using linters, formatters, and static analysis tools
### Details:
Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checking for frontend code. Set up backend code analysis with appropriate tools. Implement pre-commit hooks using Husky. Configure SonarQube or similar tool for deeper code quality analysis. Ensure CI pipeline fails on code quality issues.

## 3. Configure frontend build and deployment pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying frontend applications to staging and production environments
### Details:
Set up build process for frontend assets with proper optimization. Configure deployment to CDN or static hosting service. Implement versioning strategy for frontend releases. Add smoke tests after deployment. Configure rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.

## 4. Implement backend build and deployment automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying backend services to various environments
### Details:
Configure containerization of backend services using Docker. Set up deployment to Kubernetes or other container orchestration platform. Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies. Configure health checks and automated rollbacks. Set up API contract testing to ensure compatibility.

## 5. Integrate database migration process [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Automate database schema changes and migrations as part of the deployment pipeline
### Details:
Set up migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase. Configure migration verification in staging environment before production. Implement backup procedures before migrations. Create rollback scripts for failed migrations. Add monitoring for migration performance and impact.

## 6. Establish environment configuration management [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3, 23.4, 23.5
### Description: Implement secure and consistent management of environment-specific configurations across all deployment targets
### Details:
Set up secrets management using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Implement configuration templating for different environments. Create validation checks for configuration completeness. Establish audit logging for configuration changes. Configure environment promotion workflow from development to production.
