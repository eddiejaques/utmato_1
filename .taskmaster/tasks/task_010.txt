# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Campaign Listing and Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a dashboard view that displays all campaigns for the user's organization with filtering and sorting capabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement the `/api/v1/campaigns` GET endpoint to list campaigns for the user's organization
2. Create a dashboard component with a table/grid view of campaigns
3. Implement filtering by campaign name, date, creator, etc.
4. Add sorting functionality for all columns
5. Implement pagination for large campaign lists
6. Display key campaign metadata in the list view
7. Add quick action buttons for viewing, editing, and managing campaigns
8. Implement a search function for finding specific campaigns

# Test Strategy:
Test campaign listing with various filter and sort options. Verify pagination works correctly with large datasets. Test search functionality with different queries. Verify only campaigns from the user's organization are displayed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Campaign Listing API Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a RESTful API endpoint that returns campaign data with appropriate filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters
### Details:
Implement a GET /api/campaigns endpoint that accepts query parameters for filtering (status, date range, type), sorting (by name, date, performance), and pagination (page number, items per page). Ensure proper error handling and response formatting. Include campaign metrics in the response data.

## 2. Implement Dashboard Component Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the base dashboard component with table/grid view for displaying campaign data
### Details:
Develop a responsive React component that displays campaign data in both table and grid views with toggleable display options. Include column definitions for campaign name, status, start/end dates, budget, and key performance metrics. Implement basic styling with CSS/SCSS following the design system.

## 3. Implement Filtering Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add filtering capabilities to the dashboard to allow users to filter campaigns by various criteria
### Details:
Create filter controls for campaign status, date range, campaign type, and performance metrics. Implement filter state management using React hooks or Redux. Ensure filters are reflected in the API requests and URL parameters for shareable filtered views. Add clear filter functionality.

## 4. Implement Sorting Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add column sorting capabilities to the campaign dashboard
### Details:
Enable sorting for all relevant columns (name, date, budget, performance metrics). Implement visual indicators for sort direction. Ensure sorting state is maintained during filtering and pagination. Optimize for performance with potentially large datasets.

## 5. Implement Pagination [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add pagination controls to navigate through large sets of campaign data
### Details:
Create pagination controls with page numbers, previous/next buttons, and items per page selector. Implement efficient data fetching that only retrieves the current page of data. Maintain pagination state during filtering and sorting operations. Add loading indicators during page transitions.

## 6. Implement Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Add search capability to quickly find specific campaigns
### Details:
Create a search input that filters campaigns by name or ID. Implement debouncing to prevent excessive API calls during typing. Add highlighting of search terms in results. Ensure search works in conjunction with existing filters, sorting, and pagination.
