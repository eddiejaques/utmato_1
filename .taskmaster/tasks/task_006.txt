# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for managing user roles (Manager vs. Team Member) and enforcing appropriate permissions.
# Details:
1. Create a middleware for the backend that extracts user role from the database based on the authenticated user
2. Implement permission decorators for API endpoints that check user roles
3. Create a frontend context provider for user role and permissions
4. Implement conditional rendering of UI elements based on user role
5. Create helper functions to check permissions for specific actions
6. Ensure all API endpoints enforce the correct role requirements as specified in the PRD

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with users of different roles to verify permission enforcement. Verify UI elements are correctly shown/hidden based on user role. Test edge cases like attempting to access manager-only endpoints as a team member.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement backend middleware for role extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware to extract user roles from JWT tokens and attach them to the request object
### Details:
Develop Express middleware that decodes the JWT token, extracts the user roles, and attaches them to the request object for use in subsequent request handling. Include error handling for invalid tokens and role validation.

## 2. Create permission decorators for API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop decorators to protect API endpoints based on required roles
### Details:
Implement decorators (or middleware functions) that can be applied to API route handlers to restrict access based on user roles. Include support for multiple roles and role hierarchies if needed. Ensure proper error responses when access is denied.

## 3. Implement frontend authentication context provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a React context provider to manage user authentication state and roles
### Details:
Develop a React context provider that stores and provides access to the authenticated user's information, including their roles. Implement functions to check if a user has specific roles or permissions that can be used throughout the application.

## 4. Develop permission checking helper functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Create utility functions for checking permissions in both frontend and backend code
### Details:
Implement a set of helper functions that can be used to check if a user has the required permissions for specific actions. These should work with the role data extracted by the middleware and stored in the authentication context.

## 5. Implement conditional UI rendering based on roles [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create components and hooks for conditionally rendering UI elements based on user roles
### Details:
Develop React components and hooks that use the authentication context to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's roles. This includes hiding/showing navigation items, buttons, and other interactive elements based on permissions.

## 6. Test and document the RBAC implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the role-based access control system
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend RBAC components. Create documentation explaining the RBAC system, including how to assign roles, check permissions, and extend the system for future requirements.
