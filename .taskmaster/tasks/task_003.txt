# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Database Migration System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Alembic for database migrations to manage schema changes over time.
# Details:
Initialize Alembic in the backend project:
1. Install Alembic: `pip install alembic`
2. Initialize Alembic: `alembic init migrations`
3. Configure Alembic to use SQLAlchemy with the Supabase PostgreSQL connection
4. Create initial migration script that matches the schema defined in the PRD
5. Set up CI/CD to run migrations automatically during deployment

# Test Strategy:
Test migration process by running migrations on a test database. Verify that migrations can be applied and rolled back correctly. Ensure migration scripts are idempotent.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Initialize Alembic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Alembic migration tool in the project environment
### Details:
Install Alembic package using pip, create the initial directory structure with 'alembic init', and configure the alembic.ini file with appropriate settings for the project environment. Ensure the migration environment is properly initialized.

## 2. Configure SQLAlchemy with Supabase [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up SQLAlchemy to work with Supabase database
### Details:
Configure SQLAlchemy connection string to connect to Supabase. Update the env.py file in the Alembic directory to use the SQLAlchemy models and connection. Test the connection to ensure SQLAlchemy can properly communicate with the Supabase database.

## 3. Create Initial Migration Script [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Generate the first migration script to establish database schema
### Details:
Use Alembic's autogenerate feature to create the initial migration script based on existing SQLAlchemy models. Review the generated script for accuracy and make any necessary adjustments. Test the migration locally to ensure it applies correctly.

## 4. Implement Migration Workflow Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Document the migration process for team members
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation explaining how to create, run, and roll back migrations. Include examples of common migration scenarios and best practices for schema changes. Ensure documentation covers both local development and production deployment contexts.

## 5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline for Migrations [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Integrate database migrations into the CI/CD workflow
### Details:
Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically run migrations during deployment. Implement safeguards such as database backups before migrations and rollback mechanisms in case of failures. Set up appropriate environment variables and secrets for database access in the CI/CD environment.

## 6. Create Migration Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Implement testing procedures for database migrations
### Details:
Develop a testing framework to validate migrations before they're applied to production. Create test cases for verifying data integrity during migrations. Implement a staging environment process where migrations can be tested against production-like data before being applied to the actual production database.
