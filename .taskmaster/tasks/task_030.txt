# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance and set up monitoring to ensure performance targets are met.
# Details:
1. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for critical pages
2. Set up code splitting and lazy loading for frontend components
3. Optimize database queries with proper indexing
4. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
5. Set up performance monitoring for API response times
6. Configure frontend performance monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
7. Implement database query logging and optimization
8. Set up alerting for performance degradation
9. Create a performance testing suite

# Test Strategy:
Measure application performance using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest. Verify that API response times meet the target of <300ms for 95% of requests. Test performance with various load levels. Verify that performance monitoring correctly identifies and reports issues.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Server-Side Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up server-side rendering to improve initial page load times and SEO performance
### Details:
Implement SSR using Next.js or similar framework, configure hydration process, ensure proper data fetching on the server, and optimize the critical rendering path. Document the implementation approach and performance gains.

## 2. Implement Code Splitting and Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Break down application code into smaller chunks that load on demand
### Details:
Identify components for lazy loading, implement dynamic imports, set up route-based code splitting, optimize bundle sizes, and configure prefetching strategies for anticipated user paths.

## 3. Optimize Database Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and improve database query performance to reduce response times
### Details:
Profile existing queries, add appropriate indexes, optimize JOIN operations, implement query caching where appropriate, and refactor problematic queries. Document performance improvements with metrics.

## 4. Implement Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive caching system across the application
### Details:
Implement browser caching with appropriate headers, set up CDN for static assets, implement Redis or similar for server-side caching, and create a cache invalidation strategy. Document cache hit rates and performance improvements.

## 5. Set Up Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Implement tools and systems to continuously monitor application performance
### Details:
Set up real user monitoring (RUM), configure server performance metrics collection, implement error tracking, create performance dashboards, and set up alerting for performance degradations.

## 6. Create Performance Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.5
### Description: Develop automated tests to measure and validate performance improvements
### Details:
Implement load testing scripts, create performance regression tests, set up CI/CD integration for performance testing, establish performance budgets, and document baseline metrics for future comparison.
