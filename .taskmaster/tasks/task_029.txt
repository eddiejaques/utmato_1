# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Security Measures and Vulnerability Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement HTTPS for all connections
2. Set up proper CORS configuration
3. Add CSRF protection for relevant endpoints
4. Implement input validation on all API endpoints using Pydantic
5. Set up rate limiting for authentication and API endpoints
6. Configure security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
7. Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
8. Set up regular security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline

# Test Strategy:
Test security measures by attempting various attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.). Verify that rate limiting works correctly. Test CORS configuration with various origins. Verify that security headers are correctly set on all responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. HTTPS and CORS Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up HTTPS with proper certificates and configure CORS policies to restrict cross-origin requests.
### Details:
1. Generate/obtain SSL certificates for HTTPS
2. Configure Nginx or other web server for HTTPS
3. Implement CORS middleware in FastAPI
4. Define allowed origins, methods, and headers
5. Test CORS restrictions with cross-origin requests
6. Document the CORS policy

## 2. CSRF Protection Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection mechanisms for all state-changing operations.
### Details:
1. Add CSRF token generation to authentication flow
2. Create middleware to validate CSRF tokens

4. Implement double-submit cookie pattern
5. Test CSRF protection with simulated attacks
6. Document CSRF protection approach

## 3. Input Validation with Pydantic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive input validation using Pydantic models for all API endpoints.
### Details:
1. Create Pydantic models for all request payloads
2. Add field-level validators for complex validation rules
3. Implement custom validators for business logic constraints
4. Ensure proper error messages for validation failures
5. Test validation with boundary and malicious inputs
6. Document validation models and rules

## 4. Rate Limiting Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks on API endpoints.
### Details:
1. Research rate limiting libraries compatible with FastAPI
2. Implement IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints
3. Add user-based rate limiting for authenticated endpoints
4. Configure different limits for various endpoint types
5. Implement proper rate limit headers in responses
6. Test rate limiting with load testing tools

## 5. Security Headers Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Configure security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
### Details:
1. Implement Content-Security-Policy headers
2. Configure X-Content-Type-Options header
3. Set up X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
4. Add Strict-Transport-Security header for HTTPS
5. Configure Referrer-Policy header
6. Test headers using security scanning tools

## 6. Error Handling and Security Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1, 29.2, 29.3, 29.4, 29.5
### Description: Implement secure error handling and perform security scanning of the application.
### Details:
