# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup Authentication with Clerk
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Clerk authentication service for user management and JWT-based authentication.
# Details:
1. Create a Clerk account and project
2. Configure Clerk with Google OAuth and Email/Password authentication options
3. Install Clerk SDK in the frontend project
4. Set up authentication components for sign-up, sign-in, and user profile
5. Configure JWT verification middleware in the FastAPI backend
6. Implement protected routes that require authentication
7. Set up user session management and token refresh logic

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration and login flows with both Google OAuth and email/password. Verify JWT tokens are correctly validated by the backend. Test token expiration and refresh mechanisms. Ensure protected routes reject unauthenticated requests.

# Subtasks:

### Details:
1. Sign up for a Clerk account
2. Create a new project in the Clerk dashboard
3. Configure authentication methods (email/password, social logins)
4. Set up the application domain and redirect URLs
5. Obtain API keys and environment variables
6. Configure webhook endpoints if needed

## 2. Frontend SDK Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Install and configure the Clerk SDK in the frontend application
### Details:
1. Install Clerk React SDK packages
2. Set up environment variables for API keys
3. Implement ClerkProvider at the root of the application
4. Configure routing integration with Next.js
5. Set up proper error handling for authentication failures
6. Test basic SDK functionality

## 3. Authentication Component Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Build UI components for sign-in, sign-up, and user profile management
### Details:
1. Implement Sign In component using Clerk's SignIn component or custom UI
2. Implement Sign Up component using Clerk's SignUp component or custom UI
3. Create a user profile management page
4. Implement sign-out functionality
5. Add loading states and error handling
6. Style components to match application design

## 4. Backend JWT Verification Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create middleware to verify Clerk JWTs in backend API routes
### Details:
1. Install Clerk backend SDK
2. Create middleware for JWT verification
3. Configure middleware to extract user information from tokens
4. Implement proper error handling for invalid or expired tokens
5. Set up testing for the verification middleware (deferred)

## 5. Protected Route Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Implement route protection for authenticated-only pages and API endpoints
### Details:
1. Create higher-order components or hooks for frontend route protection
2. Implement redirect logic for unauthenticated users
3. Set up role-based access control if needed
4. Protect API routes using the JWT verification middleware
5. Add loading states for authentication checks
6. Test protected routes with authenticated and unauthenticated users (deferred)

## 6. Session Management and Token Refresh Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Implement session handling and automatic token refresh mechanisms
### Details:
1. Configure session duration and expiration settings in Clerk dashboard
2. Implement automatic token refresh logic (deferred)
3. Handle session expiration gracefully in the UI
4. Set up persistent sessions if required
5. Implement proper session cleanup on sign-out
6. Test session persistence and refresh scenarios (deferred)

# ---
# Follow-up Tasks (Deferred for Future Execution)
- Write and pass comprehensive tests for the JWT middleware
- Expand error handling for edge cases (malformed tokens, network errors)
- Implement advanced session management (token refresh, session revocation)
- Add logging and monitoring for authentication events
- Document middleware usage and integration for the team
