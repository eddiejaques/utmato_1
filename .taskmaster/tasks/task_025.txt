# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Frontend State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a state management solution using React Context or Zustand for the frontend application.
# Details:
1. Evaluate and choose between React Context and Zustand based on application needs
2. Implement a user context for storing authentication state
3. Create a campaigns context/store for managing campaign data
4. Implement a UI state store for managing modals, notifications, etc.
5. Set up proper state persistence where needed
6. Create custom hooks for accessing state
7. Implement optimistic updates for better UX
8. Add error handling and loading states

# Test Strategy:
Test state management with various user interactions. Verify that state is correctly updated and persisted where needed. Test optimistic updates and error recovery. Verify that components correctly access and update state.

# Subtasks:
## 1. State Management Library Selection and Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and implement a state management library that best fits the project requirements.
