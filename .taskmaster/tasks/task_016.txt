# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Create functionality to export campaign data to CSV format.

# Test Strategy:
Test exporting campaigns with and without associated links. Verify the CSV format is correct and includes all relevant data. Test with various campaign sizes and metadata combinations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design export button and options UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the UI elements for the campaign export functionality
### Details:
Design and implement a clean export button in the campaign view. Include a dropdown with export options (e.g., 'All data', 'Summary only', 'Custom fields'). Ensure the UI is consistent with the existing design system and is responsive across device sizes.

## 2. Implement export options modal [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a modal dialog for configuring export parameters
### Details:
Develop a modal that appears when the export button is clicked, allowing users to select specific data fields to include in the export, date ranges, and format options. Include validation to ensure at least one field is selected.

## 3. Develop data retrieval service [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create a service to fetch and prepare campaign data for export
### Details:
Implement a service that retrieves campaign data based on the selected export options. Handle pagination for large datasets and ensure all related data is properly joined. Include error handling for failed data retrieval.

## 4. Implement CSV generation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Create the functionality to convert campaign data to CSV format
### Details:
Develop the logic to transform the retrieved campaign data into properly formatted CSV. Handle special characters, ensure proper encoding (UTF-8), and implement column headers based on selected fields. Test with various data types and large datasets to ensure performance.

## 5. Create loading indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement visual feedback during the export process
### Details:
Design and implement loading indicators to show progress during data retrieval and CSV generation. Include percentage completion if possible, or use an indeterminate progress indicator for processes where progress can't be measured.

## 6. Implement file download functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Create the mechanism to deliver the CSV file to the user
### Details:
Implement the browser download functionality to deliver the generated CSV file to the user. Include proper file naming (e.g., 'campaign_name_date.csv'), handle browser security restrictions, and provide fallback methods for browsers with limited download capabilities. Test across different browsers and devices.
