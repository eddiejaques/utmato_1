# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Error Tracking with Sentry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Sentry for error tracking and monitoring in both frontend and backend.
# Details:
1. Create a Sentry account and project
2. Install Sentry SDK in the Next.js frontend
3. Install Sentry SDK in the FastAPI backend
4. Configure source map uploading during CI/CD
5. Add user context to error reports
6. Set up performance monitoring for key transactions
7. Configure alerting rules for critical errors
8. Implement Slack/email notifications for error alerts
9. Add a global error boundary in the React application

# Test Strategy:
Test error reporting by triggering various error conditions. Verify user context is correctly attached to error reports. Test performance monitoring for key transactions. Verify alerting rules trigger notifications correctly.
