# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement UTM Link Generation Form
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a form for generating UTM-tagged links associated with a campaign.
# Details:
1. Create a form component for UTM link generation
2. Pre-fill the `utm_campaign` field from the parent campaign
3. Implement a dropdown for `utm_source` with the list of 100 marketing vendors
4. Add fields for destination URL, `utm_medium`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term`
5. Implement form validation for required fields
6. Generate the full UTM-tagged URL with proper encoding
7. Implement the `/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/links` POST endpoint
8. Store the generated link in the database associated with the campaign
9. Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for the generated link

# Test Strategy:
Test link generation with various input combinations. Verify UTM parameters are correctly encoded in the URL. Test that links are correctly associated with campaigns in the database. Verify the copy to clipboard functionality works correctly.
